## Inspiration and Learning

Tutor was created as a project for the "Modern HTML & CSS from the Beginning (2024 Revamp)" course by Brad Traversy. The course covered HTML, CSS, responsive design, Git, GitHub, web hosting, web accessibility, CSS Grid, transitions, animations, and introductory JavaScript.

## Challenges and Lessons Learned

- Creating a hamburger menu was a significant challenge, requiring careful consideration of layout, positioning, and responsiveness.
- Ensuring responsiveness across various devices and screen sizes was also a hurdle, highlighting the importance of thorough testing and debugging.
- Overlooking simple techniques, resulted in unnecessarily lengthy code.
- This project reinforced the value of utility classes and the effectiveness of combining Grid and Flexbox for layout management, with Grid handling outer components and Flexbox managing inner elements.
